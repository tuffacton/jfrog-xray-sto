The processes communicate over standard input and output streams, using a protocol resembling HTTP. On a `Redirect` request from the main process, a worker process mistakenly responds with a `103 Redirect` message instead of a `201 URI Done`. The worker process appends the URL received in the `Location` header to the `Redirect` response without checking it. By manipulating the `Location` header as it passes on the network, an attacker can cause the worker to inject multiple fields into the response, including a `201 URI Done` response packet, hash values matching the update contents, and the `Filename` field. APT downloads a file named `Release.gpg` during an `apt update` operation, and saves it to a predictable location. This file contains the PGP signatures of the update package, but any content which comes before the PGP signature is ignored by APT and signature verification proceeds successfully. \r\n\r\nAttackers can trigger the exploit by adding malicious commands at the beginning of this file.

If the content-\u003etype is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT, then (i) the content-\u003eprefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits) whereupon (ii) content-\u003ename is written to the buffer. However, the check for whether the content-\u003ename actually fits also uses 'len' rather than the updated buffer length strlen(buf).

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3-\u003eMalloc-\u003eThread1-\u003eFree's-\u003eThread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.",
